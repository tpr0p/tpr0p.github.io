Thomas received a BA in Physics from the University of Chicago in 2021. There, under the guidance of Fred Chong, he developed techniques for executing quantum algorithms on NISQ devices that reduced gate errors by an order of magnitude. He completed his senior thesis in the lab of David Schuster, where he developed a numerical optimization protocol for making quantum gates robust to control imperfections and applied it to fluxonium-type superconducting circuits. For his undergraduate work, Thomas was awarded the Barry Goldwater Scholarship and a full-tuition scholarship for his senior year from UChicago Physics. Following graduation, he joined the Quantum Photonics Group at MIT as a Ph.D. student with the support of the NSFGRFP and the MIT Jacobs Presidential Fellowship. At MIT, Thomas is excited to develop photonic technologies for controlling quantum devices. He is also interested in entrepreneurship and the potential for quantum information science to revolutionize materials, medicine, and more.
